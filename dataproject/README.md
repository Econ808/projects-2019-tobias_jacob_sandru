# Data Project - Population Growth

* In this project we load population forecasting data from three different sources (*Statistics Denmark, Statistics Sweden and Statistics Norway*). We then plot a decomposition of the forecasted population growth for Denmark and an index of the population growth in all three countries. Finally we plot an age pyramid which we also simulate by looping over different inputs to a graph.
